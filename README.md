# Bumpy
This is a sample demonstration on how to identify a bump or jerk experienced while moving/travelling using android phone.
Z axis data is useful when your phone is  in horizontally placed as if you have kept it on a table. We should consider all 3 axis data and use to calculate the jerk/bump.
This code only takes into a/c for z-axis data.
What is left?
1. Server Setup
2. DTW implementation
3. Haversine formula implementation
4. Reporting : This depends on how are we going to report the survey. We can leverage social media sites of directly to govt. server endpoint , if contract could be set up.
